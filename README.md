#Teaching Department Efficiency Report

The purpose of this script is to take an excel file with teacher ytd information
and output another excel sheet that is easy to read and includes an
efficiency score

The input excel file has a time stamp, share fairly number(Tabby), and each 
teachers Year to Date (YTD) total sessions taught at that time. The share fairly
number or Tabby, is the number of sessions a teacher should be teaching at that
time. 

Students Taught  รท Share Fairly Number = Efficiency Score.
For example if Share Fairly number is 4, and a teacher took 2, that teacher
has an efficiency score of .5, meaning they took about half of what they are 
suppose to take.
